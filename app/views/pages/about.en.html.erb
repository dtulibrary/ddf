    <h1>About</h1>

    <p><span class="p-intro">The Danish National Research Database</span> is a single entry point for Danish research, Danish researchers and Danish research institutions.</p>

    <p>It aims to allow easy access to searching research publications from Danish research institutions (see also <a href="/about/search-and-get" target="_blank">Search &amp; Get</a>).</p>

    <p>The database is primarily based on data collected from the Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) of Danish universities and other Danish research institutions. All Danish institutions of higher education, government research institutes, research councils and other public institutions carrying out research can become data providers. All data providers are participating on a voluntary basis. For more, see the <a href="/about/data" target="_blank">Data page</a>.</p>

    <p>The database currently covers published literature, such as journal articles, PhD. theses, conference presentations and lecture notes.</p>

    <h2>Technical</h2>
    <p><strong>Foundation:</strong> The necessary metadata are made available for the database by the data providers from their openly accessible repositories (typically the providers CRIS) offering <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html" target="_blank">OAI-PMH</a>-based access to data in various open and well-documented data formats (for publication metadata, primarily DDF-MXD). See more under <a href="/about/data" target="_blank">Data</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Processing:</strong> Metadata are harvested, processed, deduplicated and indexed by the DTU Library Data Processing Platform into the DTU Library common <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Lucene</a>-based index, equipped with <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" target="_blank">Apache SOLR</a> as search platform.</p>

    <p><strong>Exposing:</strong> For the discovery layer, a dedicated SOLR request handler allows this <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/" target="_blank">Blacklight</a>-based user interface to search the relevant data.</p>
