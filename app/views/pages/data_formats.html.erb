    <h1>Data formats</h1>

    <p>The data indexed for publication search are publication metadata registered in the Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) of the data providers (Danish research institutions).</p>

    <p>Any data provider for this database must make publication data available:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>through an openly available <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">OAI-PMHvi</a>-based interface;</li>
      <li>in the national <a href=" http://mx.forskningsdatabasen.dk/mxd/current/">DDF-MXD</a> metadata format.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All data are acquired, processed and indexed in a fully automated process — no human intervention is applied.   The consistency, integrity and quality of the metadata exposed in this database rest on the consistency, integrity and quality of the data exposed by the CRIS systems.</p>
