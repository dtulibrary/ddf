/*
Layout depends on 1) grid and 2) viewports. Grid depends on typography.

So the whole layout is driven by typography: Letters compose to different
measures (line widths), measures compose to layout blocks, which compose
to page templates.

HOWEVER the core of typography is overriden in "../bootstrap/overrides.scss",
BECAUSE Bootstrap imposes its own typographic defaults.

Keep this in mind when modifying or adding styles.
